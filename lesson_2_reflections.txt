-- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git directory and information is set up.  This marks the tree as a git repository.

-- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the set of files you want to create a logical commit with.  It allows you to bundle files imto different commits even if many have changed.

-- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If the changes are in different files, you can add only the files that are related
into the staging area.  If mutliple changes happen in the same file, you are
SOL.  I assume.

-- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Experimental modifications.  Multiple people working on different changes.

-- How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The history becomes easy to visualize.

-- What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

So we can retain the true revision history.

-- What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Nice when it works.
