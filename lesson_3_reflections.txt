When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other people might be updading the remote in ways that are not compatible with what has been done locally.  Or, you may decide you don't want the update.
