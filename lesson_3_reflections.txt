When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

-- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other people might be updading the remote in ways that are
not compatible with what has been done locally.  Or, you may decide
you don't want the update.

-- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are like clones except only from github to github.  Used
whenever we want to copy and modify someone's github repository and
have our modification be public and share our changes back to the
orginal author.

Clones are when we want to make a copy of a reposity on our local
machine, either to use it, or modify it.

branches are when we want to make a second version history path for
a projecty we control.

-- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of
the remote stored locally?

So old versions can be compared without internet access.
